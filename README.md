# package-logic-js

Complex arithmetic package for the [Fōrmulæ](https://formulae.org) programming language.

Fōrmulæ is also a software framework for visualization, edition and manipulation of complex expressions, from many fields. The code for an specific field —i.e. arithmetics— is encapsulated in a single unit called a Fōrmulæ **package**.

This repository contains the source code for the **logic package**. It is intended to the computation of logical operations.

The GitHub organization [formulae-org](https://github.com/formulae-org) encompasses the source code for the rest of packages, as well as the [web application](https://github.com/formulae-org/formulae-js).

<!--
Take a look at this [tutorial](https://formulae.org/?script=tutorials/Complex) to know the capabilities of the Fōrmulæ arithmetic package.

### Capabilities ###

* Visualization of the [truth values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_value) *true* and *false*
* Visualization of the logical [negation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation), [conjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction), [disyunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction), [conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional), [equivalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_biconditional) and [exclusive disjunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), as $\neg p$, $p \land q$, $p \lor q$, $p \to q$, $p \leftrightarrow q$ and $p \oplus q$ respectively
